    charm_token:
      description: >-
        The token for the charm to generate new tokens.

        generate the subsequent one-time token authentication.

    pull_request_disallow_fork:
      description: >-
        Disable runs from forked repository pull requests.
        This is used to protect private-endpoint runners for security purposes. Blocks all pull
        request runs from a third party forked repository. It will still allow runs for anyone with
        write and higher permissions for the repository to run jobs from forks.

    github_app_id:
      description: >-
        The app or client ID of the GitHub App to use for communication with GitHub.
        If provided, the other github_app_* options must also be provided.
        The Github App needs to have read permission for Administration. If private repositories
        are checked, the Github App does also need read permission for Contents and Pull request.
        Either this or the github_token must be provided.
      type: string
    github_app_installation_id:
      description: >-
        The installation ID of the GitHub App to use for communication with GitHub.
        If provided, the other github_app_* options must also be provided.
        The Github App needs to have read permission for Administration. If private repositories
        are checked, the Github App does also need read permission for Contents and Pull request.
        Either this or the github_token must be provided.
      type: string
    github_app_private_key:
      # this will become a juju user secret once paas-app-charmer supports it
      description: >-
        The private key of the GitHub App to use for communication with GitHub.
        If provided, the other github_app_* options must also be provided.
        The Github App needs to have read permission for Administration. If private repositories
        are checked, the Github App does also need read permission for Contents and Pull request.
        Either this or the github_token must be provided.
      type: string
    github_token:
      description: >-
        The token to use for communication with GitHub. This can be a PAT (with repo scope)
        or a fine-grained token with read permission for Administration. If private repositories 
        are checked, the fine-grained token does also need read permission for Contents and 
        Pull request.
        Either this or the GitHub App configuration must be provided.
